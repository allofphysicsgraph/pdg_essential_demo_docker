# Demo of Docker

The repo contains a `Dockerfile` and a `Makefile`. 
The `Makefile` builds a Docker image and then runs the Docker container.

Everything else in the Physics Derivation Graph relies on these two capabilities.

To use,
```bash
make container
```
which puts you inside a Docker container.
